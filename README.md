Want to play the game? Here is [the latest version](https://palad1.github.io/Yannicks-s-game/docs/v1) (requires HTML5)

My nephew wanted to learn programming and loves videogames, so I, a dutyful uncle, set forth to teach him the basics of programming with a fun twist.

## Requirements
* [Love2d](https://love2d.org)
* A text editor (we used [Zerobrane Studio](https://studio.zerobrane.com))
* A bit of patience and lots of passion

## Lessons and Chapters

Each day we would spend a couple of hours in front of the computer and learn Lua together, as well as the Love2d api. Each day we built on what we had the previous day. I did most of the math (wrong) and the coding was done 4-handed. We stayed clear of the LUA warts (OOP) and tried to keep design patterns at bay (but we will have to cleanup after session 8, that's a given).

* [Lesson 0: hello love](../0-start)
* [Lesson 1: what is a sprite?](../1-start)
* [Lesson 2: how do I sprite my bob?](../1-start)
